STL = Containers + Algo + Iterators

1.Containers = Object which stores data.
2.Algo = Procedure to process data.
3.Interators = Object which point to an element of a Containers

Containers = 1. Sequence Containers -> Linear Fashion
vector,list,dequeve
             2.Associative Containers -> Direct Access
set/multiset,map/multimap
             3.Derived Containers -> Real world Modelling
stack (LIFO= LAST IN FIRST OUT ),queve(FIFO FIRST IN FIRST OUT),priority queve


vector -> Random Access fast
        > Middle Insertion / Del = Slow
        > Insertion/Del at the end = fast

list -> Random Access Slow
      > Middle Insertion / Del = fast
      > Insertion/Del at the end = fast

Associative Containers -> ALl operation fast expect Random excess.

Derived Containers -> Depends -> data structure.
